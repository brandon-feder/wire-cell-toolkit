#+title: Wire-Cell CUDA

This package is a mostly empty place holder for now.  In the future it
may provide Wire-Cell Toolkit components that depend on CUDA.

For now, it tests the Wire-Cell build system to *optionally* work with CUDA.

A minimal test build with CUDA goes something like:

#+begin_example
  $ NVCCFLAGS="-O3" ./wcb configure --with-cuda=/path/to/cuda [...usual...]
  $ ./wcb --target=test_simple_cuda -j1 -vv

  [... check nvcc command is as desired ...]

  execution summary 
    tests that pass 1/1 
      /home/bviren/dev/wctcuda/build/cuda/test_simple_cuda 
    tests that fail 0/1 
  'build' finished successfully (0.829s)
#+end_example
