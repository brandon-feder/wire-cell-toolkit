        /** This component drifts depos bounded by planes
         * perpendicular to the X-axis.  The boundary planes are
         * specified with the "xregions" list.  Each list is an object
         * fully specified with a "cathode" an "anode" and a
         * "response" attribute giving X locations in the same
         * coordinate system as depos of three planes.
         *
         * - cathode :: a plane which bounds the maximum possible drift.
         * - anode :: a plane which bounds the minimum possible drift.
         * - response :: a plane to which all depositions are drifted.
         *
         * If "anode" is not given then its value is take to be that of
         * "response" and vice versa and at least one must be specified.
         * A "cathode" value must be specified.
         *
         * Any depo not falling between "anode" and "cathode" will be
         * dropped.
         *
         * Any depo falling between "response" and "cathode" will be
         * drifted to the "response" plane.
         *
         * Any depo falling between "anode" and "response" will be
         * ANTI-DRIFTED to the "response" plane.  Ie, it will be
         * "BACKED UP" in space an time as if it had be produced
         * earlier and at the response plane.
         *
         * Input depositions must be ordered in absolute time (their
         * current time) and output depositions are produced ordered
         * by their time after being drifted to the response plane.
         *
         * Diffusion and absorption effects and also, optionally,
         * fluctuations are applied.  Fano factor and Recombination
         * are not applied in this component (see IRecombinationModel
         * implementations).
         *
         * Typically a drifter is used just prior to a ductor and in
         * such cases the "response" plane should be made coincident
         * with the non-physical "response plane" which defines the
         * starting point for the field response functions.  The
         * location of the response plane *realtive* to the wire
         * planes can be found using:
         *
         * $ wriecell-sigproc response-info garfield-1d-3planes-21wires-6impacts-dune-v1.json.bz2
         * origin:10.00 cm, period:0.10 us, tstart:0.00 us, speed:1.60 mm/us, axis:(1.00,0.00,0.00)
         *    plane:0, location:9.4200mm, pitch:4.7100mm
         *    plane:1, location:4.7100mm, pitch:4.7100mm
         *    plane:2, location:0.0000mm, pitch:4.7100mm
         *
         * Here, "origin" gives the location of the response plane.
         * The location of the wire planes according to wire geometry
         * can be similarly dumped.
         *
         * $ wirecell-util wires-info protodune-wires-larsoft-v3.json.bz2

         *     0: x=-3584.63mm dx=9.5250mm
         *     1: x=-3589.39mm dx=4.7620mm
         *     2: x=-3594.16mm dx=0.0000mm

         *
         * Note, as can see, these two sources of information may not
         * be consistent w.r.t. the inter-plane separation distance
         * (4.71mm and 4.76mm, respectively).  This mismatch will
         * result in a relative shift in time between the planes for
         * various waveform features (eg induction zero crossings and
         * collection peak).
         *
         * For the example above, likely candidates for "anode" X
         * locations are:
         *
         *    x = -3594.16mm + 10cm
         *
         * and
         *
         *    x = +3594.16mm - 10cm
