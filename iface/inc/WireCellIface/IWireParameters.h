    /** Interface by which parameters describing wire planes can be
     * accessed.
     *
     * Assumptions and conventions:
     *
     * - Each plane is parallel to the others and are perpendicular to
     * the X-axis.  In decreasing X value they are labeled: U, V and
     * W.
     *
     * - The wires in a plane run parallel to each other, this is
     * called the plane's direction which is also labeled U, V and W.
     *
     * - The angle of the plane is measured from the Y-axis and is
     * signed following the right-hand-rule. (Y x Wire = X).
     *
     * - The perpendicular distances ("pitch") between adjacent wires
     * is regular.  The pitch direction points toward increasing wire
     * index and is take such that (Wire x Pitch) = X
     *
     * The above is sufficient to define the wire planes, but further
     * convention helps to conceptualize things.
     *
     * U wires:
     * - angle: [0, +90]
     * - points: (+Y,+Z)
     * - pitch:  (-Y,+Z)
     * - starts: (-Y,-Z)
     *
     * V wires:
     * - angle: [-90, 0]
     * - points: (+Y,-Z)
     * - pitch:  (-Y,-Z)
     * - starts: (+Y,-Z)
     *
     * W wires:
     * - angle: 0
     * - points: +Y
     * - pitch:  +Z
     * - starts: -Z
     *
     * Given this, the wires planes are fully specified by four rays.
     *
     * \param bounds is a WireCell::Ray with its tail at the
     * negative-most corner and its head at the positive-most
     * corner of a rectangular bounding box.
     *
     * \param U is a WireCell::Ray with direction giving the plane's
     * pitch and with endpoints on wires within the bounding box.
     *
     * \param V is same but same for V wire plane.
     *
     * \param W is same but for for W wire plane.
